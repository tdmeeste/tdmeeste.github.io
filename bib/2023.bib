@inproceedings{Du2023_unimodalities,
  abstract     = {{Most datasets for multimodal emotion recognition only have one emotion annotation for all the modalities combined, which serves as a gold standard for single modalities. This procedure ignores, however, the fact that each modality constitutes a unique perspective that contains its own clues. Moreover, as in unimodal emotion analysis, the perspectives of annotators can also diverge in a multimodal setup. In this paper, we therefore propose to annotate each modality independently and to more closely investigate how perspectives between modalities and annotators diverge. Moreover, we also explore the role of annotator training on perspectivism. We find that for the different unimodal levels, the annotations made on text resemble most closely those of the multimodal setup. Furthermore, we see that annotator training has a positive influence on the annotator agreement in modalities with lower agreement scores, but it also reduces the variety of perspectives. We therefore suggest that a moderate training which still values the individual perspectives of annotators might be beneficial before starting annotations. Finally, we observe that negative sentiment and emotions tend to be annotated more inconsistently across the different modality setups.}},

    abstract = "Background: More than 400.000 biomedical concepts and some of their relationships are contained in SnomedCT, a comprehensive biomedical ontology. However, their concept names are not always readily interpretable by non-experts, or patients looking at their own electronic health records (EHR). Clear definitions or descriptions in understandable language or often not available. Therefore, generating human-readable definitions for biomedical concepts might help make the information they encode more accessible and understandable to a wider public. Objective: In this article, we introduce the Automatic Glossary of Clinical Terminology (AGCT), a large-scale biomedical dictionary of clinical concepts generated using high-quality information extracted from the biomedical knowledge contained in SnomedCT.Methods: We generate a novel definition for every SnomedCT concept, after prompting the OpenAI Turbo model, a variant of GPT 3.5, using a high-quality verbalization of the SnomedCT relationships of the to-be-defined concept. A significant subset of the generated definitions was subsequently evaluated by NLP researchers with biomedical expertise on 5-point scales along the following three axes: factuality, insight, and fluency. Results: AGCT contains 422,070 computer-generated definitions for SnomedCT concepts, covering various domains such as diseases, procedures, drugs, and anatomy. The average length of the definitions is 49 words. The definitions were assigned average scores of over 4.5 out of 5 on all three axes, indicating a majority of factual, insightful, and fluent definitions. Conclusion: AGCT is a novel and valuable resource for biomedical tasks that require human-readable definitions for SnomedCT concepts. It can also serve as a base for developing robust biomedical retrieval models or other applications that leverage natural language understanding of biomedical knowledge.",

    abstract = "This paper shines a light on the potential of definition-based semantic models for detecting idiomatic and semi-idiomatic multiword expressions (MWEs) in clinical terminology. Our study focuses on biomedical entities defined in the UMLS ontology and aims to help prioritize the translation efforts of these entities. In particular, we develop an effective tool for scoring the idiomaticity of biomedical MWEs based on the degree of similarity between the semantic representations of those MWEs and a weighted average of the representation of their constituents. We achieve this using a biomedical language model trained to produce similar representations for entity names and their definitions, called BioLORD. The importance of this definition-based approach is highlighted by comparing the BioLORD model to two other state-of-the-art biomedical language models based on Transformer: SapBERT and CODER. Our results show that the BioLORD model has a strong ability to identify idiomatic MWEs, not replicated in other models. Our corpus-free idiomaticity estimation helps ontology translators to focus on more challenging MWEs.",

Furthermore, we develop and critically evaluate several classical and neural bankruptcy prediction models using this dataset.

We also see that the binary bankruptcy prediction target does not enable our models to distinguish next year bankruptcy from an unhealthy financial situation resulting in bankruptcy in later years. Finally, we explore the use of LLMs in the context of our task. We show how GPT-based models can be used to extract meaningful summaries from the textual data but zero-shot bankruptcy prediction results are poor.
