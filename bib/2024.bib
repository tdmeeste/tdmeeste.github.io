  abstract     = {{Objective In this study, we investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to complement biomedical knowledge graphs in the training of semantic models for the biomedical and clinical domains.Materials and Methods Drawing on the wealth of the Unified Medical Language System knowledge graph and harnessing cutting-edge LLMs, we propose a new state-of-the-art approach for obtaining high-fidelity representations of biomedical concepts and sentences, consisting of 3 steps: an improved contrastive learning phase, a novel self-distillation phase, and a weight averaging phase.Results Through rigorous evaluations of diverse downstream tasks, we demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements over the previous state of the art for semantic textual similarity (STS), biomedical concept representation (BCR), and clinically named entity linking, across 15+ datasets. Besides our new state-of-the-art biomedical model for English, we also distill and release a multilingual model compatible with 50+ languages and finetuned on 7 European languages.Discussion Many clinical pipelines can benefit from our latest models. Our new multilingual model enables a range of languages to benefit from our advancements in biomedical semantic representation learning, opening a new avenue for bioinformatics researchers around the world. As a result, we hope to see BioLORD-2023 becoming a precious tool for future biomedical applications.Conclusion In this article, we introduced BioLORD-2023, a state-of-the-art model for STS and BCR designed for the clinical domain.}},

@article{Labat2024_emotwics,
	abstract = {Due to the rise of user-generated content, social media is increasingly adopted as a channel to deliver customer service. Given the public character of online platforms, the automatic detection of emotions forms an important application in monitoring customer satisfaction and preventing negative word-of-mouth. This paper introduces EmoTwiCS, a corpus of 9489 Dutch customer service dialogues on Twitter that are annotated for emotion trajectories. In our business-oriented corpus, we view emotions as dynamic attributes of the customer that can change at each utterance of the conversation. The term `emotion trajectory'refers therefore not only to the fine-grained emotions experienced by customers (annotated with 28 labels and valence-arousal-dominance scores), but also to the event happening prior to the conversation and the responses made by the human operator (both annotated with 8 categories). Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) scores on the resulting dataset are substantial and comparable with related research, underscoring its high quality. Given the interplay between the different layers of annotated information, we perform several in-depth analyses to investigate (i) static emotions in isolated tweets, (ii) dynamic emotions and their shifts in trajectory, and (iii) the role of causes and response strategies in emotion trajectories. We conclude by listing the advantages and limitations of our dataset, after which we give some suggestions on the different types of predictive modelling tasks and open research questions to which EmoTwiCS can be applied. The dataset is made publicly available at https://lt3.ugent.be/resources/emotwics.},

abstract = {The most effective second language learning occurs through extensive interpersonal interaction and tutoring. However, limited funding and a lack of language teachers often prevent students from engaging in individualised practice, a lack which can be addressed using AI and social robots. We present a system that leverages generative AI to provide customized educational content in real-time, adapting to students' skills through an engaging, visually-grounded game played alongside a social robot. To test effectiveness, we conducted a study in which Dutch high school students learned Spanish vocabulary either with or without the robot present. Results showed significant vocabulary gains regardless of robot presence, indicating the game itself, not the social embodiment, drove learning. While further refinements are needed, these findings highlight the potential for generative AI to deliver personalized language tutoring and circumvent the constraints posed by limited resources and staffing in schools. Ongoing work aims to enhance social presence and better align generative content with individuals' abilities and pacing.},
