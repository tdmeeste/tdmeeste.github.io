    abstract = "Models for bankruptcy prediction are useful in several real-world scenarios, and multiple research contributions have been devoted to the task, based on structured (numerical) as well as unstructured (textual) data. However, the lack of a common benchmark dataset and evaluation strategy impedes the objective comparison between models. This paper introduces such a benchmark for the unstructured data scenario, based on novel and established datasets, in order to stimulate further research into the task. We describe and evaluate several classical and neural baseline models, and discuss benefits and flaws of different strategies. In particular, we find that a lightweight bag-of-words model based on static in-domain word representations obtains surprisingly good results, especially when taking textual data from several years into account. These results are critically assessed, and discussed in light of particular aspects of the data and the task. All code to replicate the data and experimental results will be released.",

# Cool glasses, where did you get them? Generating visually grounded conversation starters for human-robot dialogue
@inproceedings{Janssens2022,
  abstract     = {Visually situated language interaction is an important challenge in multi-modal Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). In this context we present a data-driven method to generate situated conversation starters based on visual context. We take visual data about the interactants and generate appropriate greetings for conversational agents in the context of HRI. For this, we constructed a novel open-source data set consisting of 4000 HRI-oriented images of people facing the camera, each augmented by three conversation-starting questions. We compared a baseline retrieval-based model and a generative model. Human evaluation of the models using crowdsourcing shows that the generative model scores best, specifically at correctly referencing visual features. We also investigated how automated metrics can be used as a proxy for human evaluation and found that common automated metrics are a poor substitute for human judgement. Finally, we provide a proof-of-concept demonstrator through an interaction with a Furhat social robot.},

    abstract = "This work introduces BioLORD, a new pre-training strategy for producing meaningful representations for clinical sentences and biomedical concepts. State-of-the-art methodologies operate by maximizing the similarity in representation of names referring to the same concept, and preventing collapse through contrastive learning. However, because biomedical names are not always self-explanatory, it sometimes results in non-semantic representations. BioLORD overcomes this issue by grounding its concept representations using definitions, as well as short descriptions derived from a multi-relational knowledge graph consisting of biomedical ontologies. Thanks to this grounding, our model produces more semantic concept representations that match more closely the hierarchical structure of ontologies. BioLORD establishes a new state of the art for text similarity on both clinical sentences (MedSTS) and biomedical concepts (MayoSRS).",
