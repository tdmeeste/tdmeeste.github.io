  abstract     = {To design state-of-the-art on-chip interconnect structures, efficient modeling tools are needed that accurately incorporate all substrate loss mechanisms and the finite conductivity and shape of the metallic interconnects. In this contribution, accurate broadband macromodels are conceived for the per unit length resistance (R), inductance (L), conductance (G) and capacitance (C) parameters of such on-chip interconnects. By means of adaptive frequency sampling (AFS) the simulation cost to obtain these models is small. Additionally, passivity can be assessed and enforced. The technique is applied to the analysis of an inverted embedded microstrip (IEM) line. Compared to commercial simulation software, both in frequency and time domain, excellent agreement and superior efficiency is observed, illustrating the method's applicability for on-chip design purposes.},

@article{Demeester11_passivation,
  abstract     = {The design of high-speed metallic interconnects such as microstrips requires the correct characterization of both the conductors and the surrounding dielectric environment, in order to accurately predict their propagation characteristics. A fast boundary integral equation approach is obtained by modeling all materials as equivalent surface charge densities in free space. The capacitive behavior of a finite dielectric environment can then be determined by means of a transformation matrix, relating these charge densities to the boundary value of the electric potential. In this paper, a new calculation method is presented for the important case that the dielectric environment is composed of homogeneous rectangles. The method, based on a surface charge expansion in terms of the Robin eigenfunctions of the considered rectangles, is not only more efficient than traditional methods, but is also more accurate, as shown in some numerical experiments. As an application, the design and behavior of a microstrip passivation layer is treated in some detail.},

The presented iterative combined waveguide mode (ICWM) algorithm leads to an expansion of the longitudinal electric field inside a triangle using a combination of parallel-plate waveguide modes in three directions, each perpendicular to one of the triangle sides. This expansion is used to calculate the triangle's Dirichlet to Neumann boundary operator. Subsequently, any polygonal conductor can be modeled as a combination of triangles. The method is especially useful to investigate current crowding effects near sharp conductor corners. In a number of numerical examples, the accuracy of the ICWM algorithm is investigated, and the method is applied to some polygonal conductor configurations.},
